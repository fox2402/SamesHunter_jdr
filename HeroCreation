How to create a character:

=> Name
=> Stats
=> Talents
=> Class
=> Lineage
=> Weapon
=> Armor
=> Nanite



Stats: - Constitution => HP and Stamina modifier
       - Force => Damage and Parry modifier
       - Agility => Dodge and Precision modifier
       - Intelligence => Deduction and Spell power modifier
       - Wisdom => Resistance and Spell efficiency modifier
       
       HP = 8 + Const.mod
       Stamina = 12 + 2 * Const.mod
       
Stats are rolled however the players want to (ex: d20, best of 3 d6)
A stat modifier works just like in Pathfinder.



Talents:

Talents are abilities your hero naturally possesses or granted by his pieces of equipement.
They have various effects from stats boosting to changing attack patterns.
A character gets (1 + Int.mod) talent points per level.

 - Life => Add 1 hp for each level
 - Vigour => Add 2 stamina for each level
 - Marathon => Reduce stamina use by 1 for each level (max 50% of initial cost)
 - Energy => Add 1 stamina regeneration per unused actions
 - Power => Add 1 Force for each level
 - Sturdy => Add 1 bonus point to parry checks for each level
 - Light => Add 1 Agility for each level
 - Slippery => Add 1 bonus point to dodge checks for each level
 - Smart => Add 1 Intelligence for each level
 - Keen eye => Add 1 bonus point to detect checks for each level
 - Sagacity => Add 1 Wisdom for each level
 - Protection => Add 1 bonus point to resistance checks for each level
 - Steadfast => Transfers additional 5% of the damage to hp on parry to stamina for each level (max 4)
 - Unwaverring => Reduce damage to hp taken on successful parry by 10% for each level (max 3)
 
 - Art of drawing => Reduce by 6 the score required to critical hit on the 1st hit
 - Concentration => Add 20% damage to attacks consuming 3 actions or more
 - Ninja => Reduce enmity generation by 20%
 - Paragon => Add 20% to enmity generation



Class:

Your character can be part of one of the four main classes of the Gouvernment.

  - Scholar: Intelligent scientists and wise philsophers
             (-1 Constitution, -1 Force, +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom)
  - Soldier: Powerful warriors and experimented hunters
             (+1 Constitution, +1 Force, -1 Intelligence, -1 Wisdom)
  - Inquisitor: Swift peacekeepers and coldheaded investigators
             (-1 Force, +1 Agility, +1 Intelligence, -1 Wisdom)
  - Worker: Perseverant farmers and shrewd merchants
             (+1 Constitution, -1 Agility, -1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom)



Lineage:

Regardless of their rank, certain nanites have a certain type of lineage they belong to.
Your character lineage will decide which type of nanites you will be able to use throughout the adventure.
Lineage corresponds to the job your surfacean ancesters had and will unlock nanites' power
in correlation to that job. Lineage and Class do not have to be tied but they usually are.

Weapon:

Each weapon has a base atk, guard level, stamina cost and a basic move set.
Each move has a damage multiplier, target pattern, bonus and a damage type.
Custom move can be made during a battle and the GM will adjust the move characteristics.
Heavy weapons add the Force.mod to the precision score and base atk.
Light weapons add the Agility.mod to the precision score and the Force.mod to the base atk.

Armors:

Each armor has resistances, defences, talents and weight.
Resistance lowers the chances of being affected by a debuff and the damage from elemental attacks.
Defence lowers the damage from physical attacks of different types (Slicing, Blunt, Penetrating)
Talents grants the character with special abilities (More hp, Less stamina consumption, etc...)
High weight increases the stamina cost for movements/dodges
Low weight increases the stamina cost for parries

You may choose the composants of your 1st armor and its weight. (No Talent)

An armor's characteristics are determined by its composants:
  - Hides and furs protect against blunt attacks.
  - Scales and skins protect against slicing attacks.
  - Shells and bones protect against penetrating attacks.

An armor's efficiency is determined by its weight:
  - Light armor grants +.5 defence
  - Medium armor grants +1 defence and +1 stamina cost on dodge
  - Heavy armor grants +1.5 defence and +2 stamina cost on dodge
  
Defence, type coverage and all the other armor characteristics can be changed and upgraded
with monster materials and a smith.
