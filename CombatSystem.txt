Combat system rules:

A player at 0 or below will be knocked out.
A player at his max HP in negative or below will die.

Actions:

2 actions are allowed per turns. Only the SnS, TB and LBW can attack twice per turn.
Actions consume stamina. Not using an action during your turn gives 3 stamina.

Dodge and Parry are done preemptively during the players turn.
An enemy trying to attack a dodging/parrying character will have to roll a d20
with a higher score than the target dodge/parry score.

Targets who did not roll to dodge or parry will always take the attack.

  - Dodge => 8 + Agility.mod
             If success then damage is reduced to 0
                             PC is replaced within a 1m radius
                        else damage is multiplied by 1.2
             Stamina cost = Weapon_stamina_cost
                        
  - Parry => 8 + Force.mod + Guard.level
             If success then damage is multiplied by 0.5
                             PC lose the same number as stamina
                        else damage is multiplied by 0.8
                             PC lose the same number as stamina
             Stamina cost = Weapon_stamina_cost - Weapon_guard_level
                             
  - Move => Move to a close location
            Requires no rolls unless specific situations
            
  - Attack => Execute one of your weapons or nanites move or a custom move

Weapons:

Each weapon has a base atk, guard level, stamina cost and a basic move set.
Each move has a damage multiplier, target pattern, bonus and a damage type.
Custom move can be made during a battle and the GM will adjust the move characteristics.
Heavy weapons add the Force.mod to the precision score and base atk.
Light weapons add the Agility.mod to the precision score and the Force.mod to the base atk.
