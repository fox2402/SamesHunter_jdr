Combat system rules:

Stats: - Const => HP and Stamina modifier
       - Force => Damage and Parry modifier
       - Agility => Dodge and Precision modifier
       - Intelligence => Deduction and Spell power modifier
       - Wisdom => Resistance and Spell efficiency modifier
       
       HP = 8 + Const.mod
       Stamina = 12 + Const.mod
       

Actions:

2 actions are allowed per turns. Only the SnS, TB and LBW can attack twice per turn.
Actions consume stamina. Not using an action during your turn gives 2 stamina.

  - Dodge => 8 + Agility.mod
             If success then damage is reduced to 0
                             PC is replaced within a 1m radius
                        else damage is multiplied by 1.2
             Stamina cost = Weapon_stamina_cost
                        
  - Parry => 8 + Force.mod + Guard.level
             If success then damage is multiplied by 0.5
                             PC lose the same number as stamina
                        else damage is multiplied by 0.8
                             PC lose the same number as stamina
             Stamina cost = Weapon_stamina_cost - Weapon_guard_level
                             
  - Move => Move to a close location
            Requires no rolls unless specific situations
